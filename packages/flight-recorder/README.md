# flight-recorder

**UC2 — The "flight recorder" for AI agents.**
Transparently intercepts every LLM call and tool call, stores the full trace, and enables deterministic replay without touching live APIs.

---

## What Goes Here

- The LLM HTTP proxy (httpx transport override — intercepts **Cloudflare Workers AI** calls)
- The MCP/tool call interceptor (decorator-based)
- Cassette read/write logic (match recorded responses by normalized step key)
- The replay engine (re-executes an agent using cassette responses instead of live APIs)
- The bisect engine (finds the first diverging step between two runs)
- Hash-chained audit record writer (tamper-evident, write-ahead logging)
- D1 and **MinIO** storage clients (trace metadata and cassette blobs — MinIO, not R2)

## What Does NOT Go Here

- Evaluation logic (no graders, no verdicts) — that is `eval-engine`
- Atlassian-specific code — that is `atlassian-remote` or `atlassian-agent`
- UI or dashboard code — that is `dashboard`

## Why It Exists

When an AI agent fails in production, you cannot just re-run it — the LLM is non-deterministic, the environment has changed, and side-effecting tools (posting a comment, sending an email) may fire again. The flight recorder solves this by recording all non-deterministic boundary events so the deterministic core can re-execute identically. This package is **framework-agnostic** — it works with any Python agent, not just the UC3 Atlassian agent.

## Structure

Standard src-layout: the importable package is `src/flight_recorder/`
(`from flight_recorder.proxy.cassette import ...`); `api.py` is at the package root.

```

## Setup and Run

```bash
make test-uc2                                   # pytest + coverage (from repo root)
cd packages/flight-recorder
FLIGHT_MODE=replay uv run uvicorn api:app --port 8001   # serve /runs, /replay, /bisect
```

```python
# Record a run, then replay it with zero live API calls
import httpx
from flight_recorder import RecordingTransport, replay_run

client = httpx.Client(transport=RecordingTransport(run_id, mode="record"))
agent(client)                       # every CF Workers AI call is taped into the cassette
result = replay_run(run_id, agent)  # re-runs against the cassette
assert result.live_call_count == 0
```

For an `httpx.AsyncClient` (e.g. UC3's `cf_ai_client`), use `AsyncRecordingTransport` —
the async analogue. The cassette now keeps, per step, both the response (for replay) and
the step's full `TraceRecord` (`records`), which is the non-lossy trace `eval-engine`
loads. `write_run_manifest()` writes the one-row-per-run summary to D1.

```python
from flight_recorder import AsyncRecordingTransport, write_run_manifest

transport = AsyncRecordingTransport(run_id, mode="record")
async with httpx.AsyncClient(transport=transport) as client:
    await agent(client)             # async CF Workers AI calls are taped
```

## Key Environment Variables

| Variable | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FLIGHT_MODE` | `record` | intercept + store everything |
| `FLIGHT_MODE` | `replay` | intercept + return cassette responses |
| `FLIGHT_MODE` | `passthrough` | do nothing (production default) |
